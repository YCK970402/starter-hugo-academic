I am a research assistant at the [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), working under the mentorship of[ Prof. Chia-Lin Charlene Lee](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=58CFn84AAAAJ&hl=zh-TW&oi=ao) in the [Brain and Language Processing Lab](https://blplab.linguistics.ntu.edu.tw/). My current projects include: 

1. Employing a statistical learning paradigm to examine the role of right-hemispheric responses in syntactic processing among younger and older adults.
2. Manipulating referential load  to investigate the mechanisms underlying the Nref effect, an ERP component elicited by referentially ambiguous expressions.

I am broadly interested in psycholinguistics and neuroscience, with a focus on referential processing, ambiguity, and the role of working memory in language processing. During my master’s training, I gained extensive experience conducting EEG/ERP experiments and assisting in neurolinguistics research. Furthermore, I served as a teaching assistant for four semesters, mentoring more than 20 students in experimental design and data analysis.

I received an M.A. in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.ntu.edu.tw/) and a B.A. in [Economics](https://econ.ntu.edu.tw/?locale=en) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), with additional training in the [Neurobiology and Cognitive Science Program ](http://140.112.62.130/home). My master’s thesis, Processing of Ambiguity with Multiple Referents, supervised by  [Professor Chia-Lin Charlene Lee](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=58CFn84AAAAJ&hl=zh-TW&oi=ao), investigated the Nref effect’s sensitivity to increasing referential load and explored the possibility that domain-general resources support working memory operations across modalities.
