I am a research assistant at the National Taiwan University, working under the mentorship of Prof. Chia-Lin Charlene Lee in the Brain and Language Processing Lab. My current projects include: 

1) Using statistical learning paradigm to investigate the role of right hemispheric responses in syntactic processing of both younger and older adults 

2) Increasing the difficulty in referential resolution to investigate the underlying mechanism of Nref effect (an ERP component elicited by referentially ambiguous expressions) 

I'm broadly interested in psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, specifically in referential resolution, lexical/referential ambiguity and the role of working memory in language processing. During my training in Master's program, I learn how to conduct EEG/ERP experiments and assist in neurolinguistics research. In addition, I gained substantial teaching experience from being teaching assistant for four semesters and mentoring 14 students on conducting experiments and data analysis. 

I received a M.A. in Linguistics and a B.A. in Economics from National Taiwan University, with Neurobiology and Cognitive Science Program completed. My Master's thesis, “Processing of Ambiguity with Multiple Referents”, supervised by Prof. Chia-Lin Charlene Lee, investigates the Nref effect's sensitivity to increasing referential load and explores the possibility of general resources subserving the working memory operations across modalities.
