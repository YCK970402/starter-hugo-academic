abstract: The right hemisphere (RH) has been found to possess left hemisphere
  (LH) equivalent syntactic processing ability as indexed by the P600s to some
  grammatical errors. RH P600s, however, are sometimes associated with lower
  behavioral accuracy for grammaticality judgment (e.g., in moderate L2 learners
  or healthy older adults), and such association could reflect a detrimental
  effect for syntactic processing (due to potentially conflicting outputs across
  hemispheres) or compensatory attempts from the RH under more challenging
  processing conditions. To clarify, we recorded Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)
  from 67 young right-handers while they monaurally learned and judged the
  grammaticality of 3-element strings generated based on predetermined
  artificial grammar rules- non-adjacent dependencies between the 1st and last
  elements. We additionally manipulated the difficulty level of learning these
  dependencies by varying the size of the set from which the intervening 2nd
  elements were drawn, creating salient (i.e., easier to learn) and less salient
  (more difficult to learn) dependencies. To adjudicate between the two possible
  accounts for the RH P600, we focused on successful learners only and
  contrasted ERPs over the last 2 blocks to include data only after high
  proficiency was attained. Despite comparably high behavioral performance, we
  found a LH-only P600 effect in the easier condition (accuracy=0.98%, N=20),
  but bilateral P600 effects in the more challenging condition (accuracy=0.98%,
  N=20). These results thus disfavor the hindrance account of the RH P600
  responses, and instead support the compensatory role of the RH P600 in
  challenging syntactic processing/learning tasks.
