abstract: High vowel in Squliq Atayal has been alleged to be lowered when
  occurring adjacent to pharyngeal and uvular consonants /h/ and /q/ (Egerod,
  1966; Li, 1980; Rau, 1992). However, the observed lowering of the high vowels
  are heavily based on auditory transcription with no further examination on its
  underlying mechanism. The present study investigates the patterns of the vowel
  lowering effect in Squliq Atayal through acoustic and articulatory analyses,
  specifically for high front vowel /i/ that is either preceded or followed by
  /h/ and /q/. Recordings and Ultrasound data were collected from one native
  speaker of Squliq Atayal. The acoustic results show a vowel lowering effect
  interacts with syllable structure, while the lowered vowel is still
  distinguishable from phonemic /e/ and /ya/. Ultrasound data confirm that for
  the vowel in /ih/, the tongue is more retracted toward the pharynx with a
  still clear palatal constriction, forming a double bunched tongue shape. This
  suggests that the vowel quality of /i/ is affected by the following
  consonants, though remaining contrastive from another phoneme /e/ as acoustic
  analysis has indicated. For vowels in /iq/, however, the SSANOVA results show
  no clear retraction, possibly due to a transient transition from /i/ to /q/.
  In sum, the present study provides acoustic and articulatory evidences showing
  that in Squliq Atayal, the high front vowel /i/ is lowered when followed by
  post-velar coda and this lowering may be resulted from articulatory gestures.
  We conjecture that the tongue root of /i/ is retracted possibly due to an
  anticipatory coarticulation. The fact that the retracted /i/ is not identical
  with /e/ acoustically and articulatory may provide important insight into the
  decision of writing system.
