  Establishing reference is essential to successful discourse comprehension.
  Specifically, pronoun

  is a referential indicator containing less semantic meaning that requires a co-reference dependency

  with a previously mentioned antecedent. However, referential ambiguity arises when

  there are more than one referent is available in the context and the receiver is unable to establish

  the anaphoric relationship. This referentially ambiguous anaphor is known to elicit a sustained

  frontal negativity called the Nref effect in ERP literature [7, 9]

  Previous studies have shown that the Nref effect was elicited using both written and spoken

  ambiguous anaphors [5,7,8,10] and it reflected situation model-level instead of superficial lexicallevel

  ambiguity [4]. Yet, the underlying neural mechanisms that generate this effect is still unclear.

  One possible hypothesis suggested that the Nref effect reflects the maintenance of relevant candidates

  in the working memory waiting for further disambiguating information [9], whereas an

  alternative possibility stated that the Nref effect may reflect the operation of ”detecting” the ambiguity

  [5]. However, the extant literature is limited in providing critical evidence to distinguish

  these two hypotheses due to the experimental designs. Previous studies are restricted to examining

  the referential ambiguity arises from having two possible referents [1, 2], which yields results that

  can be equally well explained by both hypotheses.

  In this present study, we manipulate the number of potential antecedents up to three. Participants

  read a passage with one to three characters before reading the critical sentence that contains

  an ambiguous pronoun.(See Table 1) After the critical sentence, a comprehension question regarding

  either passage comprehension or pronoun resolution is then presented to encourage the

  participants to not only focus on the story but also resolve the ambiguous pronoun. The aforementioned

  two competing hypotheses make different predictions for the three-referent condition in that

  the active-maintenance hypothesis should expect the magnitude of the Nref increase as the number

  of items to be held increases, similar to several memory-related sustained negativities that have

  been reported in the literature [3, 6, 11, 12]. Alternatively, the detection hypothesis would expect

  equivalent Nref effect regardless of the number of referential candidates. The results of present

  study may provide a critical basis for revising existing theories. Clarifying the fundamental characteristics

  and functional significance of the Nref effect could thus help clarify the underlying

  mechanisms of referential processing.
