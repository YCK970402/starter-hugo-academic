abstract: "Detecting statistical regularities is key to language acquisition.
  Studies have shown that the capability of extracting statistical regularities
  from continuous strings such as speech exists in infancy and persists into
  adulthood. However, little is known about how this ability is affected by
  aging. To gain a basic understanding of statistical learning ability of older
  adults, the present study recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) of a group
  of young adults (YA, N = 29; age range = 20-24 years) and a group of older
  adults (OA, N = 24; age range = 61-83 yrs) who monaurally learned and judged
  the grammaticality of 3-element pseudoword strings generated according to
  predetermined artificial grammar rules. The experiment was conducted in four
  training-test cycles. The results showed that older adults were significantly
  less accurate in grammaticality judgment than were younger adults (averaged
  accuracy from the last two cycles: OA = 56% and YA = 84%). Nevertheless, like
  young adults, older adults showed a unilateral left-hemisphere P600
  grammaticality effect. Relative to grammatical strings, ungrammatical strings
  elicited a P600 response when perceived through the right ear, but elicited a
  sustained negativity when perceived through the left ear. These data present
  an interesting contrast to prior observations of bilateral syntactic
  processing in older adults when processing native languages. Together, these
  findings suggest that aging influences different aspects of statistical
  learning. Older adults, while being able to implicitly distinguish strings
  that adhere to or violate the exposed regularity, are less able to make
  explicit grammatical judgments based on this knowledge."
